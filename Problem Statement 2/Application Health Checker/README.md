Application Health Checker

The Application Health Checker script is a Python-based tool designed to monitor the uptime and operational status of a web application. By sending HTTP requests to the application's endpoint, the script evaluates the HTTP status codes to determine whether the application is 'up' (functioning correctly) or 'down' (unavailable or not responding). This health checker provides an automated way to ensure continuous monitoring of application availability, offering insights into the application's reliability and enabling prompt responses to any detected issues.
