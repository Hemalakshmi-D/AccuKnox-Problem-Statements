System Health Monitoring Script

This project features a Python-based System Health Monitoring Script designed to run on Linux systems, developed using Visual Studio Code. It monitors vital system metrics including CPU usage, memory usage, disk space, and running processes. The script automatically sends alerts to the console or a log file if any of these metrics exceed user-defined thresholds (e.g., CPU usage over 80%), making it a valuable tool for maintaining system health and performance.
