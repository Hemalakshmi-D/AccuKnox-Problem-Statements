Wisecow Application Containerization and Deployment

This project involves the complete containerization and Kubernetes deployment of the Wisecow application, a robust platform hosted on GitHub. The objective is to ensure that the Wisecow application is efficiently packaged into Docker containers, seamlessly deployed within a Kubernetes cluster, and continuously integrated and deployed using GitHub Actions. Additionally, the deployment is secured with TLS communication to ensure secure data transmission. Key deliverables include the development of a Dockerfile for the application, Kubernetes manifest files to orchestrate the deployment, and a CI/CD pipeline configuration to automate the building, pushing, and deploying of Docker images. This comprehensive setup ensures a streamlined and secure deployment process, enhancing the application's reliability and accessibility.
